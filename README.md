**Surgical tool tracking and feedback estimation and collision free trajactory estimation**

This research work is about estimating a fundamental feedback related to surgical tool.
Additionally, it'll also provides collision free trajectory.
Both were performed in different simulation environment.

Clone this repo and import the 'sr1' file in your catkin workspace and install the packages from 'requirements.txt'.

Use this command to launch the surgical robot in simualtion environment: roslaunch sr1 'any file from launch folder'.launch
Note: sr6 and sr7 is final version, but I recommend to play with other launch file too (have fun :)

You can run the python script from script folder.
I recommed to modify the code and play with it.
Use this command for running the python script: rosrun sr1 'python file name'.py

Warning: you may face some issues with installing and also while running the whole setup.
If you are facing those issues, then check the ERROR and install the missing package/ library.
Note: this work was performed in ROS-1 (noetic), so stick with ROS-1.
If you ought to use in ROS-2, I recommend try it youself and troubleshoot the version related issue.

For furture user and visitor, viewer,
I'm happy to help you, but I recommend please play with it and troubleshoot the issue by yourself.

On going work will be updated in this github page in future, so stay tuned! 

Complete research article will be updated soon after publication.
